# Super Mario Bros SVGs sprites

A few Mario sprites in SVG format i made for my [portfolio](https://apacha01.github.io/portfolio-frontend/)

# How i made them
In case there are assets you want but aren't here you can follow this process and make your own (you don't need to know a thing about SVGs although a bit of manual optimization wouldn't be bad):
1. Get the sprite you need in it's original size (i got them all from [here](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros/)). You'll need an editor like Photoshop or GIMP to isolate the one you want.
2. Scale that sprite up with this marvelous site called [Pixel Art Scaler](https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/).
3. Convert that scaled image to an SVG with this [free PNG to SVG converter](https://www.freeconvert.com/png-to-svg). We need to scale it up because small sprites get converted super weirdly for some reason.
4. **(Optional)** Optimize the svg produced with this [SVG Optimizer](https://svgoptimizer.com/).
5. Enjoy!

# Upload them here if you want

BUT, i got no clue how to collaborate in github so... send a message or raise an issue idk. I'll upload it myself or, if you want, just explain briefly what i should do or leave a link to learn about the subject.
